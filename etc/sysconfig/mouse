#A list of which protocol values are known can be found by running gpm -m [device] -t -help. The MDEVICE setting depends on which type of mouse you have.
#For example, /dev/ttyS0 for a serial mouse (on Windows this is COM1), /dev/input/mice is often used for USB mice and /dev/psaux for PS2 mice.
#GPMOPTS is the 'catch all' for any additional options that are needed for your hardware.
