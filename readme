Automated Linux From Scratch (alfs)

USAGE: alfs wdir deps packs procs [start]

DESCRIPTION:
alfs is a tool to automate the build of packages.
based on a csv dependencies file, alfs execute package scripts to build dependencies.
all package scripts must be placed in the same directory as this script.
in the dependencies file, all package scripts on one line must be successfully executed before executing scripts of the next line.
each package name in dependencies file must match the name of an executable script in the same directory of alfs script.
the package names in dependencies file must follow this uasge: [#]package[#param]...
a # character can be inserted at the beginning of the package name in dependencies file to indicate that the script must be executed in the current shell context, otherwise script are executed in a separate shell context.
many others # can be inserted after the package name to pass parameters to the package script.
the package urls file caintains urls to download package from.
in this file, each line must contain the package name followed by a tab character and the download url: package<tab>url...

PARAMETERS:
wdir: the working directory where all packages will be built
deps: the comma-separated-value file that list all packages dependencies and build order
packs: the file that contains urls to download packages.
procs: the number of maximum processors to use
[start]: the optional starting package in dependencies file

NOTES:
for the lfs dependencies file "lfs-deps", all files needed by scripts after the "transition" dependency need to be in the same directory as the scripts/ directory. this is because the transition script chroot to working directory and all files next to scripts/ directory get copied to working directory. alfs script get reexecuted with the new root directory as the working directory and all files required in it.
